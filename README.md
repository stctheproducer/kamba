## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: AdonisJS v6
- **Frontend**: InertiaJS v2, React 19, Shadcn UI, Assistant-UI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Weaviate (vector DB), PGLite (local-first)
- **Authentication**: Logto
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Background Jobs**: Trigger.dev
- **Analytics & Monitoring**: Posthog, OpenMeter
- **Payment Processing**: Lipila & Lenco (local), Paddle & Stripe (international)

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 16+
- Redis
- Weaviate (for RAG features)
- Cloudflare R2 account (for file storage)

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stctheproducer/kamba.git
cd kamba
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your configuration details.

4. Run database migrations

```bash
node ace migration:run
```

5. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Architecture

The application follows a service-oriented architecture to enable future scaling and feature development. Key components include:

- **Frontend Container**: React, InertiaJS, Shadcn, Assistant-UI
- **Backend API Container**: AdonisJS v6
- **Database Containers**: PostgreSQL, Weaviate, Redis
- **PGLite Instance**: Local-first database storage in the browser

The system integrates with multiple external services including Logto for authentication, AI model providers, OpenRouter API, Cloudflare R2 for storage, Posthog for analytics, Trigger.dev for background jobs, OpenMeter for usage tracking, and various payment gateways.

## Realtime Implementation

The application implements realtime features using WebSockets through AdonisJS:

- **WebSocket Server**: Handles connections from authenticated users
- **Event Emission**: Uses `@adonijs/events` throughout backend services
- **WebSocket Broadcasting**: Sends updates to relevant user connections
- **Resumable Streams**: Tracks AI generation state for resuming after disconnection
